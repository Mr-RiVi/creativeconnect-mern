# Innovation Management Web Application

Our platform is an innovative online solution that addresses limited access to resources, funding, and networks for inventors. With a user-friendly interface and the power of the MERN stack, inventors can publish their innovations, attract attention, and receive funding. The platform also aims to engage investors, entrepreneurs, and mentors who are interested in supporting and nurturing innovative ideas. Together, we can transform the way innovation is approached and create a sustainable future for all.
